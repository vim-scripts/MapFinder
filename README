This plugin is useful if you use plugins which define lots of maps and it is not easy remember them at first (for example some latex plugins). It provides commands:
Map[!]   {pattern}
Nmap[!]   {pattern}
Imap[!]   {pattern}
Smap[!]   {pattern}
Vmap[!]   {pattern}
Omap[!]   {pattern}
Lmap[!]   {pattern}
They will list maps which rhs matches the vim {pattern}. If bang is used the {pattern} is matched by the output of the corresponding map command with only first column removed (which indicates the mode).
