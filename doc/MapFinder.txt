Map finder is a small plugin which provides commands which filter the output
of |:map|, |:nmap|, |:imap|, |:cmap|, |:smap|, |:vmap|, |:omap|, |:lmap|
commands. It provides commands:
:Map[!]		{pattern}		*:Map*
:Nmap[!]	{pattern}		*:Nmap*
:Imap[!]	{pattern}		*:Imap*
:Smap[!]	{pattern} 		*:Smap*
:Vmap[!]	{pattern}		*:Vmap*
:Omap[!]	{pattern}		*:Omap*
:Lmap[!]	{pattern}		*:Lmap*
where {pattern} is a vim pattern which will filter the _rhs_ of command maps
as shown by the corresponding _map command_. If |<bang>| is added the pattern is
matched against output of [nisvol]map commands with only first column removed
(which indicates the map mode).
